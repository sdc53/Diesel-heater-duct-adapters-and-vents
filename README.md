# Diesel heater duct adapters and vents
  Adapters to convert from 42mm ID duct to 1.5" ABS and vent caps.
 I bought one of the chinese diesel heaters that came with 4 small vents.  The vents are a nonstandard size and I could not aquire more of the included 44mm OD ducting in the US easily.  So I made some adapters so that I could use 1.5" ABS pipe for my longer runs.  I also made some adjustable vent caps for those runs.
